# This is a file that contains a list of items: you can use
# them with "giveitem:" command, instead of the normal "give"
# to add custom names, lore, and enchantments.
#
# HOW TO GIVE ITEMS
#
# Here's the item called "example". To give it, in the node
# COMMAND of an icon, add "giveitem:example" and the player
# will receive that item.
#
#    COMMAND: 'giveitem:example'
#
# The format is the same of icons.
